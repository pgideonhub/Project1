Here is a SQL query for the top 5 customers in the top 10 cities with inner join, right join and subquery:			

SELECT B.customer_id, 									
	CONCAT (B.first_name,' ',B.last_name) as customer_name, 								
	D.city, 								
	E.country,								
	SUM(amount) AS total_amount_paid								
FROM payment A									
INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id									
INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id									
INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id									
INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_id = E.country_id									
RIGHT JOIN									
(SELECT C.city,									
	D.country,								
	COUNT(customer_id) 								
FROM customer A									
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id									
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id									
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id									
 	RIGHT JOIN								
 		(SELECT COUNT(customer_id), country							
		FROM customer A							
		INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id							
		INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id

		LIMIT 10) AS number_of_customers ON D.country = number_of_customers.country							
 	GROUP BY C.city, D.country								
 	ORDER BY COUNT(customer_id) DESC								
 	LIMIT 10) AS top_10_cities ON D.city = top_10_cities.city								
GROUP BY B.customer_id, B.first_name, B.last_name, D.city, E.country
