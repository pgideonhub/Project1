Here is a SQL query to find the top 10 films by revenue using inner join: 

SELECT  D.film_id, D.title AS film_title,				
        SUM(amount) as total_revenue			
FROM payment A				
INNER JOIN rental B ON A.rental_id=B.rental_id				
INNER JOIN inventory C ON B.inventory_id=C.inventory_id				
INNER JOIN film D ON C.film_id=D.film_id				
GROUP BY D.film_id, film_title				
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC				
LIMIT 10
