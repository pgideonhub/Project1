    	  CONCAT (first_name,' ',last_name) as customer_name, 			
	      D.city, 			
	      E.country,			
	      SUM(amount) AS total_amount_paid			
FROM payment A				
INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id				
INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id				
INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id				
INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_id = E.country_id				
GROUP BY B.customer_id, customer_name, D.city, E.country
